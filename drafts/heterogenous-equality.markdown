title: Heterogenous equality
---

Dependently typed languages have two types of equality: propositional and decidable.

Decidable equality is just like equality from all the other programming languages:
we have a function that checks its 2 arguments for equality at *run time*.

For expressing propositonal equality we have a type that checks its 2 arguments
for equality at *compile time*.
